  <h1>Macro Expansion in your Editor</h1>

<p><strong>Aug 07, 2017</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;ve been blown away by the tooling that Emacs provides for editing Lisp. I&#39;ve
been using the <code>evil-mode</code> package to simulate <code>vim</code> key bindings and the
<code>slime</code> package for &quot;superior&quot; Lisp editing.</p>

<p>Running the <code>slime</code> function opens a Lisp REPL on the right side of my editor.
I&#39;ve bound <code>,sc</code> to compile the current file I&#39;m editing and send it to the
REPL so I can play around with it. <code>,se</code> automaticly evalutes the expression
under my cursor and sends the result to a buffer. This has greatly sped up my
feedback loop for knowing if my code works.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been playing a lot with Lisp macros lately and my editor has surprised me
yet again!</p>

<p>Macros are like functions that manipulate your programs AST at compile time to
produce code that will run at runtime.</p>

<p>The macro I want to share with you today is for generating code that converts a
buffer of bytes into an integer.</p>

<pre><code class="lisp">(defmacro read-int-from-bytes (buffer offset size)
  `(let ((int 0))
     (declare ((signed-byte ,(* 8 size)) int))
     ,@(loop for n from 0 to (- size 1)
          collect `(setf (ldb (byte 8 (* 8 ,n)) int) (aref ,buffer (+ ,offset ,n))))
     int))
</code></pre>

<p>Oh my gosh that looks complicated!? I wonder what code it expands into when we
call it.</p>

<p>All I need to do is type <code>(read-int-from-bytes #(1) 0 1)</code> into my editor.
Hitting <code>,sm</code> calls <code>macroexpand-1</code> and sends the following code into my right
buffer.</p>

<pre><code class="lisp">(LET ((INT 0))
  (DECLARE ((SIGNED-BYTE 8) INT))
  (SETF (LDB (BYTE 8 (* 8 0)) INT) (AREF #(1) (+ 0 0)))
  INT)
</code></pre>

<p>This code looks a little simpler to understand. We first create an integer
called <code>INT</code> and set it to zero. We declare this integer will be of size 8
bits. And then we set the first and only byte of the integer to be the first
byte found in the buffer!</p>

<p>This code basicly read one byte from a given buffer. Which could be done much
more simply. But what if we want to read in a 32 bit integer rather than an 8
bit integer?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s type <code>(read-int-from-bytes #(0 1 0 0) 4)</code> into our editor and run
<code>macroexpand-1</code> again.</p>

<pre><code class="lisp">(LET ((INT 0))
  (DECLARE ((SIGNED-BYTE 32) INT))
  (SETF (LDB (BYTE 8 (* 8 0)) INT) (AREF #(0 1 0 0) (+ 0 0)))
  (SETF (LDB (BYTE 8 (* 8 1)) INT) (AREF #(0 1 0 0) (+ 0 1)))
  (SETF (LDB (BYTE 8 (* 8 2)) INT) (AREF #(0 1 0 0) (+ 0 2)))
  (SETF (LDB (BYTE 8 (* 8 3)) INT) (AREF #(0 1 0 0) (+ 0 3)))
  INT)
</code></pre>

<p>This shows the benefit of our macro. It will generate code that converts an
arbitrary number of bytes from an arbitrary offset in a buffer into a single
integer.</p>

<p>Of course... this is pretty cool. I can see what the macros I write expand into
right from my editor. What&#39;s even cooler is that I can now evaluate this
expanded code.</p>

<p>I switch my cursor to the buffer that shows the expanded macro above. And then
I hit <code>,se</code> to evaluate the expression.</p>

<pre><code class="lisp">=&gt; 256
</code></pre>

<p>This shows up in the minibuffer at the bottom of my editor.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure this macro is terribly written because I have no idea what I&#39;m doing!
But who cares... I haven&#39;t had this much fun programming in as long as I can
remember!</p>
